[.text-justify]
In many applications today, software must make decisions quickly. And the best way to do so is parallel programming in C / C ++ and Multithreading (multithread programming). Parallel programming is a programming method which allows you to execute several calculations or processes simultaneously. It is used to improve the performance of applications by using multi-core architectures and distributed systems. Parallel programming consists in breaking down a problem into sub-problublicms which can be solved simultaneously by several calculation units. This reduces the overall execution time of a program by effectively using available hardware resources. Parallel machines offer a wonderful opportunity for applications of large calculation requirements. Effective use of these machines, however, requires an in -depth understanding of their operation.

Let's see more about what computing and programming parallel...


*What is Parallel Computing ?*

*Serial Computing*
[.text-justify]
Traditionally, software has been developed with a focus on serial computation. In this conventional framework, a problem is decomposed into a discrete series of instructions that are executed sequentially, one after the other, on a single processor. This approach inherently limits the system's efficiency, as only one instruction can be processed at any given moment.

*Parallel Computing*
[.text-justify]
In contrast, parallel computing represents a significant advancement in computational methodology. At its core, parallel computing involves the simultaneous utilization of multiple computational resources to address complex problems. In this paradigm, a problem is divided into discrete components that can be solved concurrently. Each component is further segmented into a series of instructions, which are executed simultaneously across different processors. This necessitates the implementation of an overarching control and coordination mechanism to ensure the effective integration of results.

To illustrate the capabilities of parallel computing, consider the following criteria for computational problems:

1. The problem must be divisible into discrete tasks that can be solved concurrently.
2. It should allow for the execution of multiple program instructions simultaneously.
3. The use of multiple computational resources should lead to a reduction in overall solution time compared to reliance on a single resource.

*Computational Resources*

The resources utilized in parallel computing typically include:

- A single computer equipped with multiple processors or cores.
- An arbitrary number of interconnected computers operating within a network.

*Parallel Computers*
[.text-justify]
Today, virtually all standalone computers are designed with parallel processing capabilities at the hardware level. This includes multiple functional units such as L1 and L2 caches, branch predictors, prefetchers, decoders, floating-point units, graphics processing units (GPUs), and integer units. Additionally, these systems feature multiple execution units or cores and support multiple hardware threads.
[.text-justify]
Networks facilitate the connection of these standalone computers (nodes) to form larger parallel computing clusters. For instance, a typical parallel computer cluster at institutions like LLNL consists of several compute nodes, each functioning as a multi-processor system in its own right. These nodes are interconnected via high-speed networks such as Infiniband, and specialized nodes may also be employed for specific tasks.
[.text-justify]
The majority of the world’s large-scale parallel computers—commonly referred to as supercomputers—are clusters composed of hardware from a select group of well-known vendors. This evolution highlights the critical role that parallel computing plays in contemporary computational science and technology.




*CPU, GPU, GPGPU Architecture*
[.text-justify]
* *CPU*, *GPU*, and *GPGPU* architectures are all types of computer processing architectures, but they differ in their design and operation.

[.text-justify]
* *CPU*: A central processor (CPU) is a processing unit that is designed to perform various computing tasks including data processing, mathematical and logical calculations, communication between different components of a computer system, etc. Modern CPUs usually have multiple cores to process multiple tasks simultaneously.

[.text-justify]
* *GPU*: A graphics processing unit (GPU) is an architecture designed to accelerate the processing of images and graphics. GPUs have thousands of cores that allow them to process millions of pixels simultaneously, making them an ideal choice for video games, 3D modeling, and other graphics-intensive applications.

[.text-justify]
* *GPGPU*: A General Processing Architecture (GPGPU) is a type of GPU that is designed to be used for purposes other than graphics processing. GPGPUs are used to perform computations of an intensive nature using the hundreds or thousands of cores available on the graphics card. They are particularly effective for parallel computing, machine learning, and other computationally intensive areas.

[.text-justify]
In conclusion, the main difference between the three architectures CPU, GPU and GPGPU lies in their design and operation. While CPUs are designed for general computer processing, GPUs are designed for specialized graphics processing, and GPGPUs are a modified version of GPUs intended to be used for specialized computer processing other than graphics processing.


*TPU, NPU, LPU Architecture*

[.text-justify]
* *TPU*: A Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a specialized hardware processor developed by Google to accelerate machine learning. Unlike traditional CPUs or GPUs, TPUs are specifically designed to handle tensor operations, which account for most of the computations in deep learning models. This makes them incredibly efficient at those tasks and provides an enormous speedup compared to CPUs and GPUs. In this article, we’ll explore what a TPU is, how it works, and why they are so beneficial for machine learning applications.

[.text-justify]
* *NPU*: A Neural Processing Unit (NPU), is a specialized hardware accelerator designed for executing artificial neural network tasks efficiently and with high throughput. NPUs deliver high performance while minimizing power consumption, making them suitable for mobile devices, edge computing, and other energy-sensitive applications. NPUs use the traditional von Neumann architecture, which separates the memory and the processing units. TPUs use the systolic array architecture, which integrates the memory and the processing units into a single chip. NPUs have a higher peak performance than TPUs, but they also have a higher latency and power consumption. TPUs have a lower peak performance than NPUs, but they also have a lower latency and power consumption.

[.text-justify]
* *LPU*: Language Processing Units (LPUs) are a relatively new addition, designed specifically for handling the complexities of natural language processing tasks. While CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs play significant roles in the broader field of AI, LPUs offer optimized performance for generative models that deal with text, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). They're good at these tasks and might be more efficient than Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs are still great for things like graphics and AI.The true power of generative AI comes from the interplay and integration of these processing units. CPUs handle the overarching control and coordination, GPUs accelerate the bulk of computational workloads, TPUs offer specialized efficiency for deep learning, and LPUs bring a new level of performance to natural language processing. Together, they form the backbone of generative AI systems, enabling the rapid development and deployment of models that can create highly realistic and complex outputs.


*Why Use Parallel Computing?*

** The Complexity of the Real World

[.text-justify]
The natural world is characterized by a multitude of complex, interrelated events occurring simultaneously, often within a defined temporal sequence. In this context, parallel computing offers a significant advantage over serial computing, making it far more effective for modeling, simulating, and understanding intricate real-world phenomena.

** Key Aspects of Parallel Programming

*Types of Parallelism* :

1. **Data Parallelism**: This approach involves performing the same operations on different datasets, making it particularly useful for processing large volumes of data.
  
2. **Task Parallelism**: In this model, independent tasks are executed concurrently, which is advantageous in applications where multiple processes can run simultaneously.

*Programming Models* :

Several programming models exist within parallel computing, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

- **Shared Memory**: In this model, threads share the same memory space, facilitating communication between them. Libraries such as OpenMP are commonly employed in this context.
  
- **Distributed Memory**: Here, each computational unit possesses its own memory, and communication occurs through message passing, typically using protocols like the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

*Benefits of Parallel Computing* :

- **Improved Performance**: By leveraging multiple cores or machines, programs can achieve significantly faster execution times.
  
- **Scalability**: Applications can be designed to scale effectively with increasingly powerful systems by adding resources as needed.

*Challenges of Parallel Computing* :

- **Complexity**: Developing parallel programs can be more intricate than writing sequential programs due to the necessity of managing synchronization and communication between threads or processes.
  
- **Debugging Difficulties**: Errors in parallel programs, such as race conditions, can be challenging to detect and rectify.

*Main Reasons for Employing Parallel Programming* :

1. **Time and Cost Efficiency**: Theoretically, allocating additional resources to a task can reduce its completion time, leading to potential cost savings. Furthermore, parallel computers can be constructed using inexpensive commodity components.

2. **Solving Large or Complex Problems**: Many problems are so vast or intricate that solving them with a serial program is impractical or impossible, particularly when accounting for limited computer memory.

3. **Concurrency**: A single computational resource is limited to executing one task at a time. In contrast, multiple compute resources can perform numerous tasks simultaneously. For example, collaborative networks provide a global platform for individuals from around the world to meet and work together virtually.

4. **Utilizing Non-local Resources**: Parallel computing allows for the use of computational resources across wide area networks or even the Internet when local resources are insufficient.

5. **Maximizing Hardware Efficiency**: Modern computers, including laptops, are inherently parallel in architecture with multiple processors and cores. Parallel software is specifically designed to exploit this architecture effectively. In many cases, traditional serial programs fail to utilize the full potential of modern computing power.

.*RELEVANT VOCABULARY*
****

image::CPU1.jpeg[Img2,400,400]

* *Computer Hardware (CPUs, GPUs, and Memory)*

** *CPU-chip* – CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. This is the computer's main processing unit; you can think of it as the 'brain' of the computer. This is the piece of hardware that performs calculations, moves data around, has access to the memory, etc. In systems such as Princeton's High Performance Computing clusters, CPU-chips are made of multiple CPU-cores. 

** *CPU-core* – A microprocessing unit on a CPU-chip. Each CPU-core can execute an independent set of instructions from the computer.

** *GPU* –GPU stands for the Graphics Processing Unit. Originally intended to process graphics, in the context of parallel programming this unit can do a large number of simple arithmetic computations. 

** *MEMORY* – In this guide memory refers to Random-Access Memory, or RAM. The RAM unit stores the data that the CPU is actively working on.

image::ParallelProgramming1.jpeg[Img3,400,400]

* *Additional Parallelism Terminology*

** An understanding of threads and processes is also useful when discussing parallel programming concepts.

** If you consider the code you need to run as one big job, to run that code in parallel you'll want to divide that one big job into several, smaller tasks that can be run at the same time. This is the general idea behind parallel programming.

** When tasks are run as threads, the tasks all share direct access to a common region of memory. The mulitple threads are considered to belong to one process.

** When tasks run as distinct processes, each process gets its own individual region of memory–even if run on the same computer.

** To put it even more simply, processes have their own memory, while threads belong to a process and share memory with all of the other threads belonging to that process.
