= TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) form Google

A Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a specialized hardware processor
developed by Google to accelerate machine learning. Unlike traditional
CPUs or GPUs, TPUs are specifically designed to handle tensor
operations, which account for most of the computations in deep learning
models. This makes them incredibly efficient at those tasks and provides
an enormous speedup compared to CPUs and GPUs. In this article, weâ€™ll
explore what a TPU is, how it works, and why they are so beneficial for
machine learning applications.

*What Are Tensor Processing Units (TPU)?*

Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) designed specifically for machine learning. In addition,
TPUs offer improved energy efficiency, allowing businesses to reduce
their electricity bills while still achieving the same results as
processors with greater energy consumption**.** This makes them an
attractive option for companies looking to use AI in their products or
services**.** With the help of TPUs, businesses can develop and deploy
faster, more efficient models that are better suited to their needs**.**
TPUs offer a range of advantages over CPUs and GPUs**.** For instance,
they provide up to 30x faster performsance than traditional processors
and up to 15x better energy efficiency**.** This makes them ideal for
companies looking to develop complex models in a fraction of the
time**.** Finally, TPUs are more affordable than other specialized
hardware solutions, making them an attractive option for businesses of
all sizes**.**

Tensor Processing Units are Google's ASIC for machine learning. TPUs are
specifically used for deep learning to solve complex matrix and vector
operations. TPUs are streamlined to solve matrix and vector operations
at ultra-high speeds but must be paired with a CPU to give and execute
instructions.

*Applications for TPUs*

TPUs can be used in various deep learning applications such as fraud
detection, computer vision, natural language processing, self-driving
cars, vocal AI, agriculture, virtual assistants, stock trading,
e-commerce, and various social predictions.s

*_When to Use TPUss_*

Since TPUs are high specialized hardware for deep learning, it loses a
lot of other functions you would typically expect from a general-purpose
processor like a CPU. With this in mind, there are specific scenarios
where using TPUs will yield the best result when training AI. The best
time to use a TPU is for operations where models rely heavily on matrix
computations, like recommendation systems for search engines. TPUs also
yield great results for models where the AI analyzes massive amounts of
data points that will take multiple weeks or months to complete. AI
engineers use TPUs for instances without custom TensorFlow models and
have to start from scratch.

*_When Not to Use TPUs_*

As stated earlier, the optimization of TPUs causes these types of
processors to only work on specific workload operations. Therefore,
there are instances where opting to use a traditional CPU and GPU will
yield faster results. These instances include:

* Rapid prototyping with maximum flexibility
* Models limited by the available data points
* Models that are simple and can be trained quickly
* Models too onerous to change
* Models reliant on custom TensorFlow operations written in C++

|*TPU Versions and Specifications* |

|TPUv1 |The first publicly announced TPU. Designed as an 8-bit matrix
multiplication engine and is limited to solving only integers.

|TPUv2: |Since engineers noted that TPUv1 was limited in bandwidth. This
version now has double the memory bandwidth with 16GB of RAM. This
version can now solve floating points making it useful for training and
inferencing.

|TPUv3 |Released in 2018, TPUv3 has twice the processors and is deployed
with four times as many chips as TPUv2. The upgrades allow this version

|TPUv4 |This is the latest version of TPU announced on May 18, 2021.
Google's CEO announced that this version would have more than twice the
performance of TPU v3.

|Edge TPU |This TPU version is meant for smaller operations optimized to
use less power than other versions of TPU in overall operation. Although
only using two watts of power, Edge TPU can solve up to four
terra-operations per second. Edge TPU is only found on small handheld
devices like Google's Pixel 4 smartphone.
