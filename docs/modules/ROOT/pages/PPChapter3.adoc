= Star PU

*StarPU* is a task scheduling library for hybrid architectures. StarPU's
goal is to design systems in which applications are distributed across
the entire machine, powering parallel tasks to all available resources.
It keeps track of the copies of each of the data in the various memories
on board the accelerators, and provides mechanisms such as data
preloading. The calculation time has been greatly reduced, as well as
the high efficiency in the use of the different calculation resources,
the different typical workloads, especially in the case of multi-core
machines equipped with several acceleration machines.

The app provides algorithms and constraints

* CPU/GPU implementations of tasks
* A task graph, using either StarPU's rich C/C++/Fortran/Python API or
OpenMP pragmas.

StarPU internally deals with the following aspects:

* Task dependencies
* Optimized heterogeneous scheduling
* Optimized data transfers and replication between main memory and
discrete memories
* Optimized cluster communications
