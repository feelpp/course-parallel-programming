= 1. CPU, GPU, GPGPU Architecture

CPU, GPU, and GPGPU architectures are all types of computer processing
architectures, but they differ in their design and operation.


CPU: A central processor (CPU) is a processing unit that is designed to
perform various computing tasks including data processing, mathematical
and logical calculations, communication between different components of
a computer system, etc. Modern CPUs usually have multiple cores to
process multiple tasks simultaneously.

GPU: A graphics processing unit (GPU) is an architecture designed to
accelerate the processing of images and gr
